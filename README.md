# Hybrid_fitness_Fisher_geometric_model

Source code to simulate Fisher's geomtric model for two populations in allopatry, used afterwards to study the fitness of hybrids.

The C++ source code is the work of Christelle Fraïsse and colleagues and has been slightly modified to fit our framework:

* C. Fraïsse, P. A. Gunnarsson, D. Roze, N. Bierne, and J. J. Welch. "The Genetics of Speciation: Insights from Fisher’s Geometric Model". Evolution 70, no. 7 (2016): 1450–64. https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.12968.

This source code uses the Mersenne Twister pseudo-random generator:

* M. Matsumoto and T. Nishimura, "Mersenne Twister: A 623-Dimensionally
Equidistributed Uniform Pseudo-Random Number Generator", ACM Transactions on
Modeling and Computer Simulation, Vol. 8, No. 1, January 1998, pp 3-30.

R scripts produce Figures S2 to S4 by using included results of the simulations.
